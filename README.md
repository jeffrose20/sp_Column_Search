# sp_Column_Search
Dynamically search for column names across DBs on SQLServer

Created this sproc as a faster way to find columns within a database or across all databases
on a server.  Enter a string and the sproc will return all existing columns that 
contain the provided string anywhere in their name.

I consider this to be a time saving utility sproc.
